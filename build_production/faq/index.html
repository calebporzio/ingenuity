		<strong class="tc1">What is the cost?</strong>
		<p class="mb4 mt1 lh1-8 ft6">Because there is so much flexibility with amount of people, length of game, and location it is very hard to list costs. I would love to give you a personal quote after I know more about your needs and group size.</p>
		<strong class="tc1">How many people play at once?</strong>
		<p class="mb4 mt1 lh1-8 ft6">The ideal group size would be from 8 to 10 people.</p>
		<strong class="tc1">How large of a group can you handle?</strong>
		<p class="mb4 mt1 lh1-8 ft6">We can have multiple groups play in succession. It takes us less than 15 minutes to reset the room after a team plays. So we can handle large groups over a period of time.</p>
		<strong class="tc1">What are the time constraints?</strong>
		<p class="mb4 mt1 lh1-8 ft6">We have made the rooms adaptable to your needs. We can vary the length from 45 minutes to 60 minutes to 75 minutes. If something shorter or longer is requested we will do our best to meet your needs.</p>
		<strong class="tc1">How long does set-up, game reset, and clean up take?</strong>
		<p class="mb4 mt1 lh1-8 ft6">We can set-up the room in less than 1 hour. Reset, for multiple teams, takes 15 minutes. Clean up takes about 30 minutes. Our team takes care of all the details.</p>
		<strong class="tc1">Is this just for businesses or would you come to my home?</strong>
		<p class="mb4 mt1 lh1-8 ft6">Although team building for businesses is our main goal, a natural extension of this is to take the escape rooms to homes for families to experience. This can be an exciting adventure for family reunions, parties, or just hanging out with a group of friends. </p>
		<strong class="tc1">What size room is needed?</strong>
		<p class="mb4 mt1 lh1-8 ft6">We need a room that is big enough for 8 to 10 people to comfortably move around in. A typical conference room is usually perfect. Ideally we would come to your business or home first and make sure we have a good space to use.</p>
