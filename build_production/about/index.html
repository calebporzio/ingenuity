		<p class="mb2">My name is Dan Richbart. I grew up in Western New York and have been teaching Math at Erie Community College for about 25 years. Over that time, my best classes have been the ones that have learned to work well together in groups and as an entire class. So I try to build that atmosphere as much as I can. Also I have seen how various departments work together and how things like teamwork, problem solving skills, good communication, and trust can help make them successful.  In addition these things can make the workplace a much more enjoyable place to work. Conversely, working in a dysfunctional department can add unneeded stress to everyone which hurts production and the ability to enjoy your work.</p>
		<p class="mb2">I have also led a young men’s youth group for over 20 years. One of my most important responsibilities is to grow our leadership team into a unit where everyone knows their responsibilities and works together well. Being a strong team is a must.</p>
		<p class="mb2">I have always loved brainteasers, puzzles, and mysteries. For many years I created treasure hunts for my wife on her birthday. While I was at work she would have to watch a video and interpret clues and riddles to find her presents. Hopefully by the time I got home all the presents were sitting on the table.</p>
		<p class="mb2">I have been creating “escape rooms” or mystery games for many years. I found that I really enjoy creating them and also enjoy watching people experience them. In 2011 I created an escape room for youth groups which was completely in the dark….called Blackout. For the past few years I have designed escape rooms in my home for my family and friends.</p>
		<p class="mb2">Now, escape rooms are sweeping the nation. There are several excellent ones in Buffalo that have specific locations for you to go to.  My desire is to combine my two interests of team development and mystery escape games. To do this I have created a unique team building escape room experience which we bring to your location. This will allow departments a fun way to promote teamwork, problem solving, communication, and trust, right at the workplace.</p>
		<p class="mb2">A natural extension of this is to take the escape rooms to homes for families to experience. I think this would be an exciting opportunity for family reunions, parties, or just hanging out with a group of friends.</p>
