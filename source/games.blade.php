You are a little late because of traffic. When your group arrives it is obvious something is wrong. No one else is there, not even the guest of honor. Presents have not been opened. Games have not been played. Cake has not been eaten. Something is not right. Then you see the “Welcome” note.</p>

			<img src="/img/game2.jpg" alt="">
			<p class="taj mt3 ph3"><strong>You have been accused of a serious crime.</strong><br>You know you are innocent but need to prove it to the jury. You have gathered a great team of lawyers, who have been working on the case for months, and finally have the iron clad evidence that will prove your innocence.  As your team gathers for your final briefing, minutes before the trial, your office is broken into. The masked perpetrators tamper with your evidence and lock you in your office. Can you find your evidence and escape the room in time for the trial?</p>
